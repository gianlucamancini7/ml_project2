SCRIPTS RULES
-	Metrics used to evaluate each run are: mse and R^2
-	Splitting ratios: training = 0.6, testing = 0.2, validation = 0.2 (referring to total database)
-	Ridge regression deg polynomial expansion = 3
-	Y vector only u_x and u_y (predicting only horizontal velocity)
-	Discretization of y output: KbinDiscretizer with 'uniform' strategy 
-	Random State of split_test_train is 50
-	Splitting the data first splitting with train_test_split into training and 'temp' dataset; then consequently split temp into test and evaluation set. (first test_size=0.4, second test_size=0.5).
