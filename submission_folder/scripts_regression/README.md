## Scripts info
- **ridge_regression.ipynb:** perform the cross- validated ridge regression. Description of all the settings of the scripts is contained inside under *settings* markdown cell. By default, results (plots and 4 ``.txt`` files) are saved in ``/results/ ridge_regression``. Be sure that an empty image folder is already present in the result target directory. Saved plot will be overwritten; data will be added on the ``.txt`` file if already present.

- **baseline.ipynb:** perform the baseline ridge regression. Description of all the settings of the scripts is contained inside under *settings* markdown cell. By default, results (plots and 4 ``.txt`` files) are saved in ``/results/baseline``. Be sure that an empty image folder is already present in the result target directory. Saved plot will be overwritten; data will be added on the ``.txt`` file if already present.

*IMPORTANT: All the scripts are set to run with the current folder tree architecture.  Any changes in the structure should be incorporated into the scripts in their respective paths definition.*
